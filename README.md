# Project Overview

This documentation outlines key learnings and insights gained from a recent job simulation focused on phishing awareness and prevention, specifically within the context of Mastercard. The simulation provided a practical understanding of how phishing attacks are orchestrated, their potential impact, and crucial strategies for detection and mitigation. This project highlights my commitment to cybersecurity best practices and my ability to analyze and communicate complex security concepts effectively.

## Evaluating Results

This table provides crucial insights into the effectiveness of the phishing simulation across various departments. By analyzing the "Email open rate," "Email click-through rate," and "Phishing success rate," we can identify vulnerabilities and strengths within the organization's cybersecurity awareness.

### Phishing Campaign Results

| Team            | Email open rate | Email click-through rate | Phishing success rate |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------- | :-------------------- |
| IT              | 80%             | 2%                       | 0%                    |
| HR              | 100%            | 85%                      | 75%                   |
| Card Services   | 60%             | 50%                      | 10%                   |
| Reception       | 40%             | 10%                      | 0%                    |
| Engineering     | 70%             | 4%                       | 1%                    |
| Marketing       | 65%             | 40%                      | 38%                   |
| R&D             | 50%             | 5%                       | 2%                    |
| **Overall average** | **66%** | **28%** | **18%** |


## Conclusion and Recommendation

The results clearly indicate that while some departments (IT, Reception, Engineering, R&D) exhibit strong phishing awareness, others (HR, Marketing, Card Services) are highly susceptible. The overall success rate of 18% is a critical finding, highlighting a significant security gap that needs immediate attention.

The last task was to make the presentation for the security awareness training. [Presentation](Phishing_Presentation.pdf)
